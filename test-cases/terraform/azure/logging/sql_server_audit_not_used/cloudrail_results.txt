Rule: Ensure Azure database server is not set to be public
Description: Cloudrail will review settings of all of the database servers configured in Azure through the "Azure Database for …" functionality. If a database server is set to be public, Cloudrail will highlight it as a violation.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guides at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/connectivity-settings, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/howto-deny-public-network-access, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/howto-deny-public-network-access, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mariadb/howto-deny-public-network-access, in order to disable public network access for the database.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: In the database server resource (such as azurerm_postgresql_server, azurerm_mssql_server, etc.), set public_network_access_enabled to false.

Rule: Ensure SQL servers have auditing enabled
Description: Having ‘auditing’ enabled on SQL servers would help to track database activities. Cloudrail will review the MS SQL servers configuration in your environment and if a server does not have an auditing policy configured, Cloudrail will highlight it as a violation.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/auditing-overview in order to configure auditing for SQL servers.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the azurerm_mssql_server resource, add the extended_auditing_policy block and set the retention_in_days argument to 0 (unlimited) or a value greater than 90 and set the log_monitoring_enabled argument to true if you wish to send audit logs to Azure Monitor. If using the azurerm_mssql_server_extended_auditing_policy resource, create it with the same previous arguments.
