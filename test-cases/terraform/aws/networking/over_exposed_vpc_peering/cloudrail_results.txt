-----------------------------------------------
   - Exposed Resource: [aws_vpc.vpc2] (main.tf:35)
     Violating Resource: [aws_route_table.subnet2_1]  (main.tf:162)

     Evidence:
         VPC Peer aws_vpc.vpc1.id
             | VPC Peer uses CIDR block aws_vpc.vpc1.id
             | Local VPC's routing table aws_route_table.subnet2_1 has a route matching CIDR block
             | Local VPC is potentially overexposing resources peering VPC
         Local VPC aws_vpc.vpc2.id
