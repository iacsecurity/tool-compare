  [AWS087][ERROR] Resource 'aws_redshift_cluster.default' is being deployed outside of a VPC
  /src/main.tf:1-8


       1 | resource "aws_redshift_cluster" "default" {
       2 |   cluster_identifier = "tf-redshift-cluster"
       3 |   database_name      = "mydb"
       4 |   master_username    = "foo"
       5 |   master_password    = "Mustbe8characters"
       6 |   node_type          = "dc1.large"
       7 |   cluster_type       = "single-node"
       8 | }
       9 | 

  Impact:     Redshift cluster does not benefit from VPC security if it is deployed in EC2 classic mode
  Resolution: Deploy Redshift cluster into a non default VPC

  See https://tfsec.dev/docs/aws/AWS087/ for more information.
