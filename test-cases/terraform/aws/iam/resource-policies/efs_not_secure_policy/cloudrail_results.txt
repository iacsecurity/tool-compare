Rule: Ensure use of EFS file system policy, and no action wildcards are being used
Description: Using wildcard actions may inadvertently allow users to take actions you do not want to allow them to do. In addition, using a resource policy will provide an additional layer of security. It is a best practice to use a resource policy and give specific permissions only.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/access-control-overview.html#access-control-manage-access-intro-resource-policies to modify EFS file system policy in order to avoid using wildcard actions.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the aws_efs_file_system_policy resource, modify policy argument in order to avoid using wildcard actions.
 - 1 Resources Exposed:
-----------------------------------------------
   - Exposed Resource: [aws_efs_file_system.not_secure] (main.tf:5)
     Violating Resource: [aws_efs_file_system_policy.not_secure_policy]  (main.tf:13)

     Evidence:
             | The policy attached to the Elastic File System aws_efs_file_system.not_secure is using wildcard action elasticfilesystem:*, and principal AWS: *, without any condition

Rule: Ensure EFS filesystems being created are set to be encrypted at rest
Description: Cloudrail will review the EFS filesystems being created in your environment. If a filesystem is not set to encrypt at rest, Cloudrail will highlight it as a violation. This rule will only flag a violation for resources that are not yet created.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/encryption-at-rest.html to enable encryption at rest for EFS filesystems.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the aws_efs_file_system resource, set encrypted argument to true.
 - 1 Resources Exposed:
-----------------------------------------------
   - Exposed Resource: [aws_efs_file_system.not_secure] (main.tf:5)
     Violating Resource: [aws_efs_file_system.not_secure]  (main.tf:5)

     Evidence:
             | The Elastic File System aws_efs_file_system.not_secure is not set to use encryption at rest


-----------------------------------------------
Rule: Ensure all resources that can be tagged have at least one tag
Description: Some organizations require that all resources have at least one tag set. This rule will review the resources that can be tagged, and make sure each one has a tag that is not the Name tag. Resources that are not tagged will be flagged.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Access the specific resource in the AWS console and add tags.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: Add a tags section to the resource with at least one tag beyond the Name tag.
 - 1 Resources Exposed:
-----------------------------------------------
   - Exposed Resource: [aws_efs_file_system.not_secure] (main.tf:5)
     Violating Resource: [aws_efs_file_system.not_secure]  (main.tf:5)

     Evidence:
             | Resource Elastic File System aws_efs_file_system.not_secure does not have any tags set other than "Name"

Cloudrail ran this assessment without any policies and so all rule violations show as warnings.
You can increase a rule's enforcement level by creating a Policy in the Web UI and adding the rule to it.
