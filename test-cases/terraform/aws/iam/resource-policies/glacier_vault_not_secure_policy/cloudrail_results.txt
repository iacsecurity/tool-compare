Rule: Ensure use of S3 Glacier vault policy, and no action wildcards are being used
Description: Using wildcard actions may inadvertently allow users to take actions you do not want to allow them to do. In addition, using a resource policy will provide an additional layer of security. It is a best practice to use a resource policy and give specific permissions only.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonglacier/latest/dev/vault-access-policy.html to modify S3 Glacier vault policy in order to avoid using wildcard actions.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the aws_glacier_vault resource, modify policy argument in order to avoid using wildcard actions.

Cloudrail ran this assessment without any policies and so all rule violations show as warnings.
You can increase a rule's enforcement level by creating a Policy in the Web UI and adding the rule to it.
