WARNINGs found:
Rule: Ensure all resources that can be tagged have at least one tag
Description: Some organizations require that all resources have at least one tag set. This rule will review the resources that can be tagged, and make sure each one has a tag that is not the Name tag. Resources that are not tagged will be flagged.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Access the specific resource in the AWS console and add tags.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: Add a tags section to the resource with at least one tag beyond the Name tag.

Rule: Ensure no role uses an overly wide principal for assume role policy
Description: When a role is created, a "trust policy" is used to declare who can assume the role. The principal of the trust policy must be specific, and not use the "*" value.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow AWS's guidance on how to write secure IAM role trust policies: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-trust-policies-with-iam-roles/ iac_remediation_steps: For the aws_sagemaker_endpoint_configuration resource, set kms_key_id argument to a Key ARN.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: Edit the assume_role_policy under the aws_iam_role, and either make the Principal more specific or add the use of a condition in the policy.

Cloudrail ran this assessment without any policies and so all rule violations show as warnings.
You can increase a rule's enforcement level by creating a Policy in the Web UI and adding the rule to it.
