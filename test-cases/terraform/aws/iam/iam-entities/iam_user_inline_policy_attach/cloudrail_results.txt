Rule: Ensure IAM permissions are not given directly to users
Description: Best practices dictate that IAM permissions are given to roles, groups, etc., and never directly to users.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_groups_create.html to create an IAM group with the permission policy. Remove the permission policy from the user and follow the guide at to add the IAM user to an IAM group.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: Remove the permission policy attached to the user. Create a new aws_iam_group resource and attach the permission policy. Use the resource aws_iam_user_group_membership for adding the user to the group.

Cloudrail ran this assessment without any policies and so all rule violations show as warnings.
You can increase a rule's enforcement level by creating a Policy in the Web UI and adding the rule to it.
