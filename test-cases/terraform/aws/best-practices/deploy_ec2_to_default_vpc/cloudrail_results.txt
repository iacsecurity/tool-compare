Rule: Ensure all used default security groups of every VPC restrict all traffic
Description: Using default security groups in general is inadvisable. By locking security groups down, you are validating that if anyone uses them by accident, they will realize before any security issues occur.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/working-with-security-groups.html#deleting-security-group-rule to update the security group rules.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the resource aws_default_security_group, update the inline ingress and egress rules.
 - 1 Resources Exposed:
-----------------------------------------------
   - Exposed Resource: [aws_instance.t2-instance] (main.tf:49)
     Violating Resource: [sg-pseudo-ba0cfb9d-c554-4b52-8ae9-0c96a9953a73]  (Not found in TF)

     Evidence:
         VPC aws_default_vpc.default
             | aws_instance.t2-instance uses ENI eni-pseudo-7153c0d1-4207-49bb-8387-db4cec5cdb52
             | The ENI is secured by default Security group sg-pseudo-ba0cfb9d-c554-4b52-8ae9-0c96a9953a73 and allows all traffic


-----------------------------------------------
Rule: Ensure the default VPC is not used
Description: Many AWS resources can be configured to reside in a specific VPC. If parameters are left to their default values, AWS may place the resource in the default VPC. This isn’t a good practice, as it’s best to specifically configure such parameters. Cloudrail will determine if resources are placed in the default VPC.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html to create specific Security Groups for those resources.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: Create aws_security_group resources for those AWS resources using default VPC security group.
 - 1 Resources Exposed:
-----------------------------------------------
   - Exposed Resource: [aws_instance.t2-instance] (main.tf:49)
     Violating Resource: [aws_instance.t2-instance]  (main.tf:49)

     Evidence:
         Default VPC
             | aws_instance.t2-instance is defined within the default VPC.


-----------------------------------------------
Rule: Ensure IMDSv2 is used and IMDSv1 is disabled
Description: There have been hacks in the past caused by the use of IMDSv1. It is now best practice to disable IMDSv1 and use IMDSv2. It’s important to test the disablement of IMDSv1 carefully, as it may cause issues in an application’s execution (if it using an old SDK, for example).
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-service.html to change the instance metadata for existing instances. Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-service.html to configure instance metadata for new instances.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the aws_instance resource, in metadata_options block, set http_tokens argument to required.
 - 1 Resources Exposed:
-----------------------------------------------
   - Exposed Resource: [aws_instance.t2-instance] (main.tf:49)
     Violating Resource: [aws_instance.t2-instance]  (main.tf:49)

     Evidence:
             | The EC2 Instance aws_instance.t2-instance is allowing IMDSv1


-----------------------------------------------
Rule: Allow only private AMIs to be used
Description: Some organizations may only allow the use of private AMIs. If this rule is enabled, any EC2 instance attempting to use a public AMI will be flagged.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instances-and-amis.html in order to terminate flagged EC2 instances and create new EC2 instance with an approved AMI.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the aws_instance resource, update the ami argument to set an approved AMI. Terraform will destroy and create new resources.
 - 1 Resources Exposed:
-----------------------------------------------
   - Exposed Resource: [aws_instance.t2-instance] (main.tf:49)
     Violating Resource: [ami-0b0ea68c435eb488d]  (Not found in TF)

     Evidence:
             | The EC2 Instance aws_instance.t2-instance uses AMI ami-0b0ea68c435eb488d, which is public


-----------------------------------------------
Rule: Ensure all resources that can be tagged have at least one tag
Description: Some organizations require that all resources have at least one tag set. This rule will review the resources that can be tagged, and make sure each one has a tag that is not the Name tag. Resources that are not tagged will be flagged.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Access the specific resource in the AWS console and add tags.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: Add a tags section to the resource with at least one tag beyond the Name tag.

-----------------------------------------------
Rule: Ensure EC2 instance is EBS optimized
Description: Cloudrail will review the EC2 instances configuration in your environment. If it is not configured to be EBS-optimized, Cloudrail will highlight it as a violation.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-optimized.html to enable EBS optimization for an EC2 instance.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the aws_instance resource, set the ebs_optimized parameter to true.

-----------------------------------------------
Rule: Ensure EC2 instance has detailed monitoring enabled
Description: Cloudrail will review the EC2 instances configuration in your environment. If an instance does not have detailed monitoring configured, Cloudrail will highlight it as a violation.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-cloudwatch-new.html in order to enable detailed monitoring for an EC2 instance.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the aws_instance resource, set the monitoring argument to true.

Cloudrail has listed "pseudo" objects in the above results.
These are resources that don't exist yet, or don't show in the Terraform input, but we know will be created in the real live environment.

Cloudrail ran this assessment without any policies and so all rule violations show as warnings.
You can increase a rule's enforcement level by creating a Policy in the Web UI and adding the rule to it.
