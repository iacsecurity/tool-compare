       6 |     account_ids = ["123456789012"]
       7 |     regions     = ["us-east-2", "us-east-1", "us-west-1", "us-west-2"]
       8 |   }
       9 | }
      10 | 

  Impact:     Sources that aren't covered by the aggregator are not include in the configuration
  Resolution: Set the aggregator to cover all regions
