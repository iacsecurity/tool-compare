Rule: Ensure use of KMS key policy, and no action wildcards are being used
Description: Using wildcard actions may inadvertently allow users to take actions you do not want to allow them to do. In addition, using a resource policy will provide an additional layer of security. It is a best practice to use a resource policy and give specific permissions only.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html to modify key policy policy in order to avoid using wildcard actions.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the aws_kms_key resource, modify policy argument in order to avoid using wildcard actions.

Rule: Ensure all resources that can be tagged have at least one tag
Description: Some organizations require that all resources have at least one tag set. This rule will review the resources that can be tagged, and make sure each one has a tag that is not the Name tag. Resources that are not tagged will be flagged.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Access the specific resource in the AWS console and add tags.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: Add a tags section to the resource with at least one tag beyond the Name tag.

Cloudrail ran this assessment without any policies and so all rule violations show as warnings.
You can increase a rule's enforcement level by creating a Policy in the Web UI and adding the rule to it.
