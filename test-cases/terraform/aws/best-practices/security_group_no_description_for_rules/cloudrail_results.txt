Rule: Ensure IMDSv2 is used and IMDSv1 is disabled
Description: There have been hacks in the past caused by the use of IMDSv1. It is now best practice to disable IMDSv1 and use IMDSv2. It’s important to test the disablement of IMDSv1 carefully, as it may cause issues in an application’s execution (if it using an old SDK, for example).
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-service.html to change the instance metadata for existing instances. Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-service.html to configure instance metadata for new instances.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the aws_instance resource, in metadata_options block, set http_tokens argument to required.
 - 1 Resources Exposed:
-----------------------------------------------
   - Exposed Resource: [aws_instance.ec2] (main.tf:61)
     Violating Resource: [aws_instance.ec2]  (main.tf:61)

     Evidence:
             | The EC2 Instance aws_instance.ec2 is allowing IMDSv1


-----------------------------------------------
Rule: Allow only private AMIs to be used
Description: Some organizations may only allow the use of private AMIs. If this rule is enabled, any EC2 instance attempting to use a public AMI will be flagged.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instances-and-amis.html in order to terminate flagged EC2 instances and create new EC2 instance with an approved AMI.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the aws_instance resource, update the ami argument to set an approved AMI. Terraform will destroy and create new resources.
 - 1 Resources Exposed:
-----------------------------------------------
   - Exposed Resource: [aws_instance.ec2] (main.tf:61)
     Violating Resource: [ami-0b0ea68c435eb488d]  (Not found in TF)

     Evidence:
             | The EC2 Instance aws_instance.ec2 uses AMI ami-0b0ea68c435eb488d, which is public

Rule: Ensure all security groups and rules have a description detailing the rule
Description: Cloudrail will review your security groups. If a security group is using a default description, or has a rule which does not include a description, this rule will trigger.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html to update the security group or security group rules description field.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the aws_security_group and aws_security_group_rule resources, set description argument with a proper value. Note, this will force the re-creation of the security group and all resources that depend on it. This is an AWS limitation.
 - 1 Resources Exposed:
-----------------------------------------------
   - Exposed Resource: [aws_security_group.default] (main.tf:15)
     Violating Resource: [aws_security_group.default]  (main.tf:15)

     Evidence:
             | The Security group aws_security_group.default does not have a description for the ingress rule of 10.0.0.0/24 for ports 443:443 using protocol TCP


-----------------------------------------------
Rule: Ensure all resources that can be tagged have at least one tag
Description: Some organizations require that all resources have at least one tag set. This rule will review the resources that can be tagged, and make sure each one has a tag that is not the Name tag. Resources that are not tagged will be flagged.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Access the specific resource in the AWS console and add tags.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: Add a tags section to the resource with at least one tag beyond the Name tag.

Rule: Ensure EC2 instance is EBS optimized
Description: Cloudrail will review the EC2 instances configuration in your environment. If it is not configured to be EBS-optimized, Cloudrail will highlight it as a violation.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-optimized.html to enable EBS optimization for an EC2 instance.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the aws_instance resource, set the ebs_optimized parameter to true.

     Evidence:
             | The EC2 Instance aws_instance.ec2 is not EBS optimized


-----------------------------------------------
Rule: Ensure EC2 instance has detailed monitoring enabled
Description: Cloudrail will review the EC2 instances configuration in your environment. If an instance does not have detailed monitoring configured, Cloudrail will highlight it as a violation.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-cloudwatch-new.html in order to enable detailed monitoring for an EC2 instance.

Cloudrail ran this assessment without any policies and so all rule violations show as warnings.
You can increase a rule's enforcement level by creating a Policy in the Web UI and adding the rule to it.
