-----------------------------------------------
   - Exposed Resource: [aws_sqs_queue.cloudrail] (main.tf:5)
     Violating Resource: [aws_sqs_queue.cloudrail]  (main.tf:5)

     Evidence:
             | The SQS queue aws_sqs_queue.cloudrail                             is not set to use encryption at rest

Rule: Ensure use of SQS queue policy, and no action wildcards are being used
Description: Using wildcard actions may inadvertently allow users to take actions you do not want to allow them to do. In addition, using a resource policy will provide an additional layer of security. It is a best practice to use a resource policy and give specific permissions only.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-overview-of-managing-access.html to modify SQS queue policy in order to avoid using wildcard actions.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the aws_sqs_queue_policy resource, modify policy argument in order to avoid using wildcard actions.

     Violating Resource: [aws_sqs_queue.cloudrail]  (main.tf:5)

Rule: Ensure all resources that can be tagged have at least one tag
Description: Some organizations require that all resources have at least one tag set. This rule will review the resources that can be tagged, and make sure each one has a tag that is not the Name tag. Resources that are not tagged will be flagged.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Access the specific resource in the AWS console and add tags.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: Add a tags section to the resource with at least one tag beyond the Name tag.

   - Exposed Resource: [aws_sqs_queue.cloudrail] (main.tf:5)
     Violating Resource: [aws_sqs_queue.cloudrail]  (main.tf:5)

     Evidence:
             | Resource SQS queue aws_sqs_queue.cloudrail does not have any tags set

Cloudrail ran this assessment without any policies and so all rule violations show as warnings.
You can increase a rule's enforcement level by creating a Policy in the Web UI and adding the rule to it.
