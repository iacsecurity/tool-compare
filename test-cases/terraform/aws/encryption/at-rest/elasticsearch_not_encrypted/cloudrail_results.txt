Rule: Ensure Elasticsearch Domain is not publicly accessible
Description: Cloudrail will review all of the Elasticsearch domains configured in your environment. For each domain it will review if it is set to be publicly accessible.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-createupdatedomains.html to configure VPC access instead of Public access in Network configuration section.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the aws_elasticsearch_domain resource, in vpc_options block, set subnet_ids and security_group_ids arguments.

Rule: Ensure use of Elasticsearch Service domain policy, and no action wildcards are being used
Description: Using wildcard actions may inadvertently allow users to take actions you do not want to allow them to do. In addition, using a resource policy will provide an additional layer of security. It is a best practice to use a resource policy and give specific permissions only.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-ac.html#es-ac-types-resource to modify Elasticsearch Service domain policy in order to avoid using wildcard actions.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the aws_elasticsearch_domain_policy resource, modify policy argument in order to avoid using wildcard actions.
 - 1 Resources Exposed:
-----------------------------------------------
   - Exposed Resource: [aws_elasticsearch_domain.example] (main.tf:1)
     Violating Resource: [aws_elasticsearch_domain.example]  (main.tf:1)

     Evidence:
             | There is no resource policy or no statements attached to aws_elasticsearch_domain.example


-----------------------------------------------
Rule: Ensure Elasticsearch Domain has logging enabled
Description: Cloudrail will review the Elasticsearch Domains configuration in your environment. If a domain does not have logging enabled, Cloudrail will highlight it as a violation.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/es-createdomain-configure-slow-logs.html in order to configure log publishing for the Elasticsearch domain.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the aws_elasticsearch_domain resource, set the log_publishing_options block with enabled argument set to true, log_type argument set to any of the valid values, and cloudwatch_log_group_arn argument set to the ARN of the CloudWatch Log Group.

     Evidence:
             | The ElasticSearch Domain aws_elasticsearch_domain.example does not have logging configured at all


-----------------------------------------------

Cloudrail ran this assessment without any policies and so all rule violations show as warnings.
You can increase a rule's enforcement level by creating a Policy in the Web UI and adding the rule to it.
