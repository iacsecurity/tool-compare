CloudTrail Log File Validation Disabled, Severity: LOW, Results: 1
CIS ID: CIS Security - CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmark v1.4.0 - Rule 3.2
Title: Ensure CloudTrail log file validation is enabled
Description: CloudTrail log file validation creates a digitally signed digest file containing a hash of each log that CloudTrail writes to S3. These digest files can be used to determine whether a log file was changed, deleted, or unchanged after CloudTrail delivered the log. It is recommended that file validation be enabled on all CloudTrails.

CloudTrail Multi Region Disabled, Severity: MEDIUM, Results: 2
CIS ID: CIS Security - CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmark v1.4.0 - Rule 3.1
Title: Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions
Description: AWS CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your account and delivers log files to you. The recorded information includes the identity of the API caller, the time of the API call, the source IP address of the API caller, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the AWS service. CloudTrail provides a history of AWS API calls for an account, including API calls made via the Management Console, SDKs, command line tools, and higher-level AWS services (such as CloudFormation).

CloudTrail Log Files Not Encrypted, Severity: HIGH, Results: 1
CIS ID: CIS Security - CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmark v1.4.0 - Rule 3.7
Title: Ensure CloudTrail logs are encrypted at rest using KMS CMKs
Description: AWS CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for an account and makes those logs available to users and resources in accordance with IAM policies. AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is a managed service that helps create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt account data, and uses Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) to protect the security of encryption keys. CloudTrail logs can be configured to leverage server side encryption (SSE) and KMS customer created master keys (CMK) to further protect CloudTrail logs. It is recommended that CloudTrail be configured to use SSE-KMS.
