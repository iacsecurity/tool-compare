Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DAXEncryptionAtRest.html to enable encryption at rest.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the aws_dax_cluster resource, in server_side_encryption block, set enabled argument to true.
