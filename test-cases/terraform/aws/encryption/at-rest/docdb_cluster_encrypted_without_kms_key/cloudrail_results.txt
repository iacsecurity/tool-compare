Rule: Ensure DocDB clusters being created are set to be encrypted at rest using customer-managed CMK
Description: Cloudrail will review the DocDB clusters being created in your environment. If a cluster is not set to encrypt at rest using a customer-managed CMK, Cloudrail will highlight it as a violation. This rule will only flag a violation for resources that are not yet created.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/encryption-at-rest.html to enable encryption at rest using a customer-managed CMK.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the aws_docdb_cluster resource, set the argument storage_encrypted to true and set the argument kms_key_id to use a customer-managed CMK.
