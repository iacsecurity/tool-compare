  [AWS087][ERROR] Resource 'aws_redshift_cluster.default' is being deployed outside of a VPC
  /src/main.tf:5-12


       2 |   region = "us-west-1"
       3 | }

       5 | resource "aws_redshift_cluster" "default" {
       6 |   cluster_identifier = "tf-redshift-cluster"
       7 |   database_name      = "mydb"

      11 |   cluster_type       = "single-node"
      12 | }
      13 | 

  Impact:     Redshift cluster does not benefit from VPC security if it is deployed in EC2 classic mode
  Resolution: Deploy Redshift cluster into a non default VPC

  See https://tfsec.dev/docs/aws/AWS087/ for more information.

  [AWS094][WARNING] Resource 'aws_redshift_cluster.default' does not have encryption enabled

  Impact:     Data may be leaked if infrastructure is compromised
  Resolution: Enable encryption using CMK
