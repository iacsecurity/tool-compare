  [GEN003][WARNING] Block 'aws_redshift_cluster.default' includes a potentially sensitive attribute which is defined within the project.
  /src/main.tf:9


       6 |   cluster_identifier = "tf-redshift-cluster"
       7 |   database_name      = "mydb"
       8 |   master_username    = "foo"
       9 |   master_password    = "Mustbe8characters"

  Impact:     Block attribute could be leaking secrets
  Resolution: Don't include sensitive data in blocks

  Impact:     Redshift cluster does not benefit from VPC security if it is deployed in EC2 classic mode
  Resolution: Deploy Redshift cluster into a non default VPC
