Rule: Ensure S3 buckets are set to be encrypted at rest
Description: Cloudrail will review the S3 buckets in your environment. If an S3 bucket is not set to be encrypted at rest, and the bucket is not public, Cloudrail will highlight it as a violation.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/serv-side-encryption.html to enable S3 bucket encryption at rest.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the aws_s3_bucket resource, in server_side_encryption_configuration, rule, apply_server_side_encryption_by_default block, set sse_algorithm argument to an allowed value.
 - 1 Resources Exposed:
-----------------------------------------------
   - Exposed Resource: [aws_s3_bucket.cloudrail] (main.tf:5)
     Violating Resource: [aws_s3_bucket.cloudrail]  (main.tf:5)

     Evidence:
             | The S3 Bucket aws_s3_bucket.cloudrail is not set to be encrypted at rest


-----------------------------------------------
Rule: Ensure S3 buckets have versioning enabled
Description: Using versioning is a good practice to deal with accidental deletion or modifications. Cloudrail will review your buckets to ensure versioning is enabled. This rule is not context aware
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/manage-versioning-examples.html to enable S3 bucket versioning.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the aws_s3_bucket resource, in versioning block, set enabled argument to true.
 - 1 Resources Exposed:
-----------------------------------------------
   - Exposed Resource: [aws_s3_bucket.cloudrail] (main.tf:5)
     Violating Resource: [aws_s3_bucket.cloudrail]  (main.tf:5)

     Evidence:
             | The S3 Bucket aws_s3_bucket.cloudrail does not have versioning enabled


-----------------------------------------------
Rule: Ensure S3 bucket objects are set to be encrypted at rest
Description: Cloudrail will review the S3 bucket objects being created in your Terraform plan. If a bucket object is not set to encrypt at rest, within a bucket that is not public, Cloudrail will highlight it as a violation.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/add-object-encryption.html to enable S3 bucket object encryption at rest.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the aws_s3_bucket_object resource, set server_side_encryption argument to "AES256".
 - 1 Resources Exposed:
-----------------------------------------------
   - Exposed Resource: [aws_s3_bucket_object.object] (main.tf:18)
     Violating Resource: [aws_s3_bucket_object.object]  (main.tf:18)

     Evidence:
             | The S3 Bucket object aws_s3_bucket_object.object is not set to be encrypted at rest


-----------------------------------------------
Rule: Ensure use of S3 bucket policy, and no action wildcards are being used
Description: Using wildcard actions may inadvertently allow users to take actions you do not want to allow them to do. In addition, using a resource policy will provide an additional layer of security. It is a best practice to use a resource policy and give specific permissions only.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-policy-language-overview.html to modify S3 bucket policy in order to avoid using wildcard actions.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the aws_s3_bucket_policy resource, modify policy argument in order to avoid using wildcard actions.
 - 1 Resources Exposed:
-----------------------------------------------
   - Exposed Resource: [aws_s3_bucket.cloudrail] (main.tf:5)
     Violating Resource: [aws_s3_bucket.cloudrail]  (main.tf:5)

     Evidence:
             | There is no resource policy or no statements attached to aws_s3_bucket.cloudrail


-----------------------------------------------
Rule: Enforce use of HTTPS in S3 bucket policy
Description: Access to objects in S3 should only be done via HTTPS. Blocking HTTP can be done by including a SecureTransport condition in the S3 bucketâ€™s policy.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/s3-bucket-policy-for-config-rule/ to create an S3 bucket policy that enforces the use of HTTPS.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the aws_s3_bucket_policy resource, ensure the policy denies all actions on the bucket and objects when the request meets the condition (aws:SecureTransport == false).
 - 1 Resources Exposed:
-----------------------------------------------
   - Exposed Resource: [aws_s3_bucket.cloudrail] (main.tf:5)
     Violating Resource: [aws_s3_bucket.cloudrail]  (main.tf:5)

     Evidence:
             | The S3 Bucket aws_s3_bucket.cloudrail does not have a policy with the aws:SecureTransport condition


-----------------------------------------------
Rule: Ensure all resources that can be tagged have at least one tag
Description: Some organizations require that all resources have at least one tag set. This rule will review the resources that can be tagged, and make sure each one has a tag that is not the Name tag. Resources that are not tagged will be flagged.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Access the specific resource in the AWS console and add tags.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: Add a tags section to the resource with at least one tag beyond the Name tag.

-----------------------------------------------
Rule: Ensure S3 bucket has access logging enabled
Description: Cloudrail will review the S3 buckets configuration in your environment. If a bucket does not have access logging enabled, Cloudrail will highlight it as a violation.
Remediation Steps - Cloud Console: Follow the guide at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/enable-server-access-logging.html in order to enable server access logging for an S3 bucket.
Remediation Steps - Terraform: For the aws_s3_bucket resource, set the logging block with target_bucket argument set to the name of an S3 bucket that will receive the log objects.

Cloudrail ran this assessment without any policies and so all rule violations show as warnings.
You can increase a rule's enforcement level by creating a Policy in the Web UI and adding the rule to it.
